The application were made in React using Javascript (JSX), HTML5, CSS. Furthermore, it uses Spotify API calls to analyze playlists, and Firebase to handle accounts.</p>

                     The concept creation was an iterative process with user testing and interviews of low-fi as well as high-fi prototypes, made using classic paper and pen and Figma.</p>
